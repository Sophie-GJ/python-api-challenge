Module 6 Homework

I got some awesome help from classmate Paul Moses on this assignment, as well as a tutor (Lebuso Philly) who helped explain errors in my code to me and helped me get my ducks in a row.

I'll admit, I definitely suffered letting this one sit on the backburner for so long, and ran into some issues. I will attempt to troubleshoot and solve them if I have time.
